I am a PhD student at Stockholm University. I mainly work on understanding ion channels from MD simulations in Prof. Erik Lindahlâ€™s group. My daily workflow involves setting up simulations, running simulations on our own clusters or the HPC center, and performing various analyses on the trajectories in my jupyter notebook.
